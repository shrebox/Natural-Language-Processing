# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository includes the codes for the following topics:

1. [Edit Distance](https://github.com/shrebox/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/1.%20Edit%20Distance)
2. [Regex](https://github.com/shrebox/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/2.%20Regex)
3. [Discriminative and Generative Models](https://github.com/shrebox/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/3.%20Generative%20and%20Discriminative%20Models)
4. [HMM - Viterbi Algorithm](https://github.com/shrebox/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/4.%20HMM%20-%20Veterbi%20Algorithm)
5. [NLP Tools](https://github.com/shrebox/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/5.%20NLP%20Tools):
   - Word Similarity (Word2vec)
   - Document Similarity (Doc2Vec)
   - Spacy (Lemmatization, POS Tagging, NER, Word Similarity)

Each directory contains these files:

* ```$ Problem_Statement.jpg``` #the problem statement.
* ```$ Solution.py``` #contains the solution code.
* ```$ Report.pdf``` #contains the detailed analysis of the problem and it's solution explaination.

:alien: Do checkout the **Information Retrieval (IR)** codes compilation too [here](https://github.com/shrebox/Information-Retrieval)!

I'll also try to add resources below this relevant to NLP research:

* https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/courses/col873/spring2020/
* [ACL Year-Round Mentorship Program](https://mentorship.aclweb.org/Home.html) for NLP.
